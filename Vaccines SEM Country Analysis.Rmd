# Introduction 
This supplementary document shows the results of the factor analysis and structural equation modelling for Nigeria, Uganda and Guinea separately.

For each country, the factor analysis was repeated, which may have resulted in different factors from the main paper. Then, the measurement and structural models were run.

The factor analysis for Nigeria produced 4 factors: 

```{r}
table_NG <- data.frame(
  Factor = c("Support for vaccination from others (A)", "Bad service delivery experience (B)", "Belief that vaccines are harmful (C)", "Belief in religious protection (D)"), 
  Variables = c("My spouse / partner helped/ ensured that my child was vaccinated (E14_3_E14), My mother/ mother-in-law  helped/ ensured that my child was vaccinated (E14_4_E14), It is normal in this community to vaccinate your children (E14_6_E14), Religious leaders are supportive of vaccination (E14_7_E14), I trust that the government knows what is right for children  (E14_8_E14)", "The clinic or hospital or outreach site where the vaccination takes place is far away from where I live (E7_1_E7), It is not safe to travel to the clinic or hospital where the vaccination takes place (E7_5_E7), I am too busy to go to the clinic or hospital for vaccinations (E7_10_E7), The clinic or hospital is dirty (E8_3_E8)", "Having many vaccinations at once is hard for children to bear, (E6_3_E6), It is difficult for me to manage the side effects (fever, rash, pain) of vaccination (E6_7_E6), Vaccines are a way for global/western countries/organisations to control us (E6_9_E6)", "My religious faith protects me and my family from harm (C5_1_C5), My religious faith heals me and my family from illnesses (C5_2_C5), God is the only protection needed against harm (C5_3_C5), My religious faith guides decisions in my life (C5_4_C5)")
)

table_NG_flex <- flextable(table_NG)
table_NG_flex <- width(table_NG_flex, width = 3)

```

The measurement model for these factors is given below. 
```{r}
# Create the outcome variable 
data_NG <- data_NG %>% mutate(outcome = SS11)
data_NG$outcome <- fct_collapse(data_NG$outcome,
                                 "Undervac" =  c("Not vaccinated", "Partially vaccinated"))


model0_NG <- 
  'A =~ E14_3_E14 + E14_4_E14 + E14_6_E14 + E14_7_E14 + E14_8_E14
   B =~ E7_1_E7 + E7_5_E7 +  E7_10_E7 + E8_3_E8
   C =~ E6_3_E6 + E6_7_E6 + E6_9_E6
   D =~ C5_1_C5 + C5_2_C5 + C5_3_C5 + C5_4_C5'


model0_NG.fit <- cfa(model = model0_NG, 
                  data = data_NG)

summary(model0_NG.fit, standardized = TRUE, fit.measures = T)

fit_NG<- modificationindices(model0_NG.fit, sort = TRUE)
```
The measurement model showed an acceptable fit to the data: CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMR = 0.04


## Structural Model 
The structural model for Nigeria is given below. 

```{r}
model1_NG <- 
  'A =~ E14_3_E14 + E14_4_E14 + E14_6_E14 + E14_7_E14 + E14_8_E14
   B =~ E7_1_E7 + E7_5_E7 +  E7_10_E7 + E8_3_E8
   C =~ E6_3_E6 + E6_7_E6 + E6_9_E6
   D =~ C5_1_C5 + C5_2_C5 + C5_3_C5 + C5_4_C5
   outcome ~ A + B + C + D'


model1_NG.fit <- cfa(model = model1_NG, 
                  data = data_NG, 
                  ordered = "outcome", 
                  link = "probit")

summary(model1_NG.fit, standardized = TRUE, fit.measures = T)

model_parameters(model1_NG.fit, ci = 0.95, standardize = FALSE, component = c("regression"))
model_parameters(model1_NG.fit, ci = 0.95, standardize = TRUE, component = c("regression"))
```


## Interpretation
The structural model is shown to be a good fit to the data (CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.03, SRMR = 0.04).

In the regression analysis, Support for vaccination from others (Factor A) was observed to lead to an increase in probability of vaccination (B- unstandardised coefficient = 0.51, $\beta$- standardised coefficient = 0.37, p<0.001). Bad service delivery experience (Factor B) was observed to lead to a decrease in probability of vaccination (B = -0.35, $\beta$ = -0.20, p=0.006). Neither Belief that vaccines are harmful (Factor C) nor Belief in religious protection (Factor D) appear to have a relationship with the vaccination outcome. (C: B = -0.046, $\beta$ = -0.013, p=0.85; D: B = -0.07, $\beta$ = -0.03, p=0.43)

```
The factor analysis for Uganda produced 4 factors:

                                 "Undervac" =  c("Not vaccinated", "Partially vaccinated"))

summary(model0_UG.fit, standardized = TRUE, fit.measures = T)

# fit_UG<- modificationindices(model0_UG.fit, sort = TRUE)
```
The measurement model showed an acceptable fit to the data: CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.03, SRMR = 0.04.


## Structural Model 
The structural model for Uganda is given below. 

```{r}
model1_UG <- 
  'A =~ C5_1_C5 + C5_2_C5 + C5_3_C5 + C5_4_C5
   B =~ E9_3_E9 + E14_6_E14 + E14_7_E14 + E14_8_E14
   C =~ E7_6_E7 + E7_5_E7 + E7_8_E7 + E7_10_E7

summary(model1_UG.fit, standardized = TRUE, fit.measures = T)

model_parameters(model1_UG.fit, ci = 0.95, standardize = FALSE, component = c("regression"))
model_parameters(model1_UG.fit, ci = 0.95, standardize = TRUE, component = c("regression"))
```


## Interpretation
The structural model is shown to be a good fit to the data (CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.03, SRMR = 0.04). 

In the regression analysis, only Vaccination is practically difficult (Factor C) was observed to have an impact on the vaccination outcome, making it less likely (B = -0.48, $\beta$ = -0.39, p=0<0.001). The other factors had no observed effect on the outcome (Belief in religious protection: B = 0.061, $\beta$ = 0.046, p=0.92; Vaccination is a norm and worth doing: B = -0.083, $\beta$ = -0.043, p=0.57 Poor service delivery experience: B = 0.052, $\beta$ = 0.049, p=0.72).

## Interpretation
The structural model is shown to be a good fit to the data (CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMR = 0.04).

In the regression analysis, there was some evidence that Belief in religious protection (Factor A) is observed to increase the probability of full vaccination (B = 0.135, $\beta$ = -0.069, p= 0.08). Support for vaccination from others (Factor B) was observed to increase the probability of vaccination (B = 0.462, $\beta$ = 0.239, p<0.001). Belief that vaccines are harmful (Factor C) was observed to decrease the probability of vaccination (B = -0.267, $\beta$ = -0.213, p= 0.001) and Poor service delivery experience (Factor D) was observed to increase it (B = 0.130, $\beta$ = 0.123, p=0.05)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
